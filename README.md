## Install

### Option 1: TizenBrew (simplest)

1. Turn on Developer Mode on the TV: open Apps, type `12345`, switch Developer mode on, enter your PC's IP address, then reboot the TV.
2. Install [TizenBrew](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrew/blob/main/docs/README.md) on the TV with the TizenBrew Installer (one-time).
3. In TizenBrew open Module Manager, Add GitHub Module, and enter `miladosos/30nama-tv`.
4. Launch "30nama" from the TizenBrew home screen.

Playback uses the TV's HTML5 player here (AVPlay is not available inside TizenBrew).

### Option 2: prebuilt .wgt

1. Turn on Developer Mode on the TV: open Apps, type `12345`, switch Developer mode on, enter your PC's IP address, then reboot the TV.
2. Download `30nama-v*.wgt` from the [latest release](https://github.com/miladosos/30nama-tv/releases/latest).
3. Install [Apps2Samsung](https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung/releases/latest) (Windows, Linux, macOS or Android). It handles your Samsung certificate and re-signs the package for your TV.
4. In Apps2Samsung select your TV, choose a custom `.wgt`, pick the downloaded file and install. Tizen 7+ TVs ask you to sign in to a Samsung account once to create a certificate.

### Option 3: build from source

First turn on Developer Mode on the TV: open Apps, type `12345`, switch Developer mode on, enter your PC's IP address, then reboot the TV.

Requires [Tizen Studio](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download) (CLI tools + TV extension), a Samsung certificate that includes your TV's DUID, and Git Bash (the scripts target Windows + Git Bash; `TIZEN_HOME` defaults to `/c/tizen-studio`).

```
./install-wizard.sh                              # guided: reads the DUID, creates certificate and profile
./build.sh <security-profile> [<tv-ip>:26101]    # manual build; with a target it also installs and launches
```

## Optional: TMDB setup (build-from-source only)

This repo uses TMDB to add trending rows, cast, reviews and recommendations. It is off by default and the app works fully without it.

**Build-from-source only.** The token is baked in at build time, so this only applies when you [build from source](#option-3-build-from-source). The TizenBrew module and the prebuilt `.wgt` never include a token, so TMDB stays off there.

1. Create a free account at themoviedb.org and copy your **API Read Access Token** (v4) from Settings, API.
2. Copy the example file:
   ```
   cp tizen-app/js/tmdb-token.example.js tizen-app/js/tmdb-token.js
   ```
3. Open `tizen-app/js/tmdb-token.js` and paste the token between the quotes:
   ```js
   N.config.tmdbToken = 'eyJhbGciOi...';
   ```
4. Rebuild and reinstall. The Home screen then shows the extra rows, and Details gains cast, reviews and recommendations.

## Development

Run the app in a desktop browser with a small proxy (no dependencies, Node 18+):

```
cd tizen-app
node tools/devserver.js 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/. The proxy forwards API and HLS requests to avoid CORS. See `tizen-app/README.md` for developer notes and `design/DESIGN.md` for the design spec.

## Credits

This project started as a fork of [msharifi99/30nama-tizenos](https://github.com/msharifi99/30nama-tizenos) by Rebin Sharifi, which built the original Tizen app, the QR login, the AVPlay player, the TizenBrew packaging and the build tooling. Kudos and thanks to Rebin: this version is a redesign built on top of that work.
